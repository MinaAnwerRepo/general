1- FTP  :  file Transfer Protocol 
         designing for file Transfer between server and client 
		 well - suited for long document 
		 web service that uses this protocol is said to be asynchronous web service'
		 
		 ex : demo for client uploading file to provider 
		 
		 client send request to FTPserver
         provider poll for request 
         then provider will send response to server
         client will poll for response
		 
    note : FTP is asynchronous as both client and server does not have notifications they depends on regular polling for new Messages . 
	
    FTP:is a great protocol to handle comp. to comp.conversation with large web services files.    	
	
	
2- 	SMTP : simple mail Transfer Protocol 
    POP : post office Protocol 
   
3- HTTP : hyper text Transfer Protocol 
          sync communication 
		  client send request and Wait 
		  provider will response immediately 
		  
    list of http Methods : 
	    Get,Head,Post,Put,Delete,Trace,Options,Connect,Patch
		
	most popular verbs : 
    Get : get data 
    Post : add data 
    Delete : Delete Data 
    PUT : update data (update every thing) . 

	demo : http://services.explorecalifornia.org/pox/tours.php?packageid=5
	
	=> http: is the protocol 
	service.explorecalifornia.org : is host
	pox/tours.php : is resource root 
	?packageid=5 : is Parameters 
	
    HTTP Request have many formats : 
	1- normal syntax 
	data will be like :

		<parameters>
		  <packageid>5</packageid>
		</parameters>
		
	
	3- post syntax with json 
	   request will have extra two keys  in header:
        Accept : application/json 
        Content-Type : application/json
